# neither: a dylib carries the path it was BUILT at, baked into whatever loads it, so a copied library is
# looked for where it used to live and the program dies on start. `install_name_tool` rewrites those
# paths to `@rpath`, and `@rpath` is pointed at the bundle's own Frameworks directory.

# THE LINKS ARE KEPT AS LINKS, and that is the difference between an 80 MB download and a third of it.
# OCCT installs every module under three names - `libTKernel.dylib` -> `libTKernel.7.9.dylib` ->
# `libTKernel.7.9.3.dylib`, one file and two links to it. A plain `cp` follows each link and writes THREE
# full copies: 144 files for 48 modules, measured on the runner. Only one of the three is ever loaded -
# the name written into the dependencies - so the other two were pure weight.
#
# `-RP` copies links as links on both toolchains (POSIX: with -R and no -H/-L, a link is copied, not
# followed), and `zip -y` stores them as links instead of expanding them again in the archive.

# UNSIGNED, AND SAID SO IN BOTH LANGUAGES. Without an Apple signature the system marks the download as
# quarantined and refuses to open it: "the app is damaged, move it to the Bin" - which it is not.
#
# THE RIGHT-CLICK IS NOT THE WAY ANY MORE. These notes used to say "Control-click and choose Open", the
# advice that worked for years. Reported behaviour: on a current macOS it does nothing - the same refusal
# appears, and the program went to the Bin instead. Recent releases block code that carries no signature
# from an identified developer in every condition, and the Control-click exception went with them.
#
# What is left is the mark itself: `xattr -cr` clears the quarantine attribute, and the program then opens
# by an ordinary double click. It is done once per download - an extended attribute stays cleared, a
# restart does not bring it back - so the steps are written out plainly, for a person who has never opened
# a terminal.

QymCAD - build for macOS (Apple Silicon).

FIRST RUN. The build carries no Apple developer signature, and macOS marks everything downloaded
from the internet as "quarantined": it will say the app is damaged and offer to move it to the Bin.
It is not damaged. The mark has to be cleared, once.

  1. Unpack the archive.

  2. Open Terminal: Command+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter.

  3. Type this into it, with a space at the end. Do NOT press Enter yet:

        xattr -cr 

  4. Drag QymCAD.app into the Terminal window - the path fills itself in. Now press Enter.
     Nothing is printed in reply; that is how it should be.

  5. Open QymCAD.app with an ordinary double click.

The mark is gone for good on this copy: a restart does not bring it back. A build downloaded anew
has to be cleared the same way.

Requires macOS 12 or newer, an Apple Silicon machine.

QymCAD - сборка для macOS (Apple Silicon).

ПЕРВЫЙ ЗАПУСК. У сборки нет подписи разработчика Apple, а macOS помечает всё скачанное из интернета
«карантином»: она скажет, что программа повреждена, и предложит переместить её в Корзину. Она не
повреждена. Метку нужно снять, один раз.

  1. Распакуйте архив.

  2. Откройте Терминал: Command+Пробел, наберите «Терминал», Enter.

  3. Наберите в нём вот это, с пробелом в конце. Enter пока НЕ нажимайте:

        xattr -cr 

  4. Перетащите QymCAD.app мышью прямо в окно Терминала — путь подставится сам. Вот теперь Enter.
     В ответ ничего не напечатается, так и должно быть.

  5. Откройте QymCAD.app обычным двойным щелчком.

Метка снята навсегда для этой копии: перезагрузка её не вернёт. Сборку, скачанную заново, придётся
освободить так же.

Требуется macOS 12 или новее, компьютер на Apple Silicon.
