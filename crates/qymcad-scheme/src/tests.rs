//!
//! 1. **The census is complete.** The list of readers is written by hand, and forgetting a field in it is
//!    easy: the code compiles, and the colour simply drops out of the settings and out of every check
//!    below — quietly. The test compares the list against the source itself.
//! 2. **Every colour is legible on its own background.** Not six selected ones but ALL of them —
//!    otherwise the check defends exactly what somebody once remembered to list.
