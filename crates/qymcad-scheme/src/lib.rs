//! THE COLOUR SCHEME - ONE SOURCE OF COLOUR INSTEAD OF LITERALS ON THE SPOT.
//!
//! Reported: the light theme did not repaint the viewport and the sketcher - they stayed black; nor did it
//! repaint the horizontal bar of the active tool. The causes were specific, and both structural:
//!
//! - the viewport background was filled with `Color32::from_gray(26)` - it never asked about the theme;
//! - the tool bar was built by a function **without `&self`**, so it could not look at the theme even if
//!   it had wanted to.
//!
//! But mending those two lines would have been mending a symptom. The interface layer holds **266 uses of
//! `Color32` and 108 distinct literals**: while colour stays a number at the point of use, the theme will
//! always lag behind - every new tool brings a colour of its own and drifts away from the scheme again.
//!
//! So the colours here are named BY MEANING (`sketch_line`, `error`, `preview`) rather than by appearance
//! ("yellow"): the code asks for a meaning, the scheme answers with a colour. A scheme is data, not code,
//! hence:
//!
//! 1. **The dark scheme is A TRANSCRIPTION OF WHAT EXISTS**, literal for literal. The present look was
//!    said to be liked; so this is no place for taste, this is a place for precision.
//! 2. **The light one is DERIVED BY A RULE rather than by inversion** (see [`toward_light`]), plus manual
//!    exceptions where the rule is blind. The rule matters more than the list: it extends to colours that
//!    do not exist yet - otherwise every new tool would mend the light scheme by hand all over again.
//! 3. **A scheme of your own is a file**, by the same means as the languages: copy it, edit it, drop it
//!    alongside.
//!
//! # Why there are so many fields
//!
//! There are about seventy, and that is not sprawl but a census of what exists: that is how many DIFFERENT
//! roles colour really has in this interface. Squeezing them into "a pretty dozen" would mean changing a
//! look that is liked as it is.
//!
//! # What the name decides
//!
//! **The role, not the value.** One colour shared by two different roles is no reason to merge the names:
//! `sketch_axis_idle` and `panel_border` are both grey today, but in another scheme they will part ways,
//! and there would be nowhere to call a panel border "a sketch axis" from.
//!
//! The other way round is harder. The literals had drifted: `255,200,90`, `250,200,90`, `255,200,80`,
//! `240,200,90` - one and the same amber, typed four times from memory. One role, different numbers.
//! Those are brought under one name: the disagreement is exactly the disease.
//!
//! Where the difference within one role was VISIBLE, merging the names would change the look, so it was
//! decided case by case: the measuring line, amber in 3D and green in the sketch, is one green line. The cut
//! line, which had shared its name by an accidental match of colour, has one of its own: they are different
//! tools.
