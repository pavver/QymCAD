//! HOW FAR BEHIND THE WORLD WE ARE — and it says so out loud.
//!
//! Three breakages in two days turned out to be one fault wearing three coats: MSYS2 moved under the
//! build, `rust-version` went stale unnoticed, and a graphics stack two years old started killing the
//! program on other people's Windows 11. Nothing watched the gap. There were 186 sets of checks here,
//! and half a dozen guards catching a Russian letter in a comment or text painted past the edge of a
//! window - and not one of them noticed that the renderer was seven releases behind.
//!
//! THIS GUARD DOES NOT DECIDE ANYTHING. Its job is to put the gap in front of a person: which package,
//! how far behind, and what that package does in the program. Whether to raise a version is decided
//! together and deliberately - a version raised quietly and shipped means the trouble reaches people
//! while the person answering for the release knows nothing about it.
//!
//! It works off `tools/deps.toml` rather than the network. A test that reaches for the network goes red
//! on a train and in an aeroplane, and a test like that is the first one silenced. The snapshot is
//! refreshed by hand: `python3 tools/check_deps.py --refresh`.
