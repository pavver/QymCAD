//! THE SETTINGS REMEMBER THEMSELVES — the whole class, not three cases.
//!
//! The grid step and the rotation step were reported. On inspection it turned out that SIX settings out
//! of thirteen did not survive a restart, and among them the THEME itself: `set_visuals` was called on a
//! click but was stored nowhere — choose the light one, restart, and it is dark again.
//!
//! The cause was not three forgotten fields. The value lived as a field of `App` while the list of what
//! gets saved was written out separately by hand — forgetting to add to it was THE NORM: the compiler is
//! silent, the test does not turn red, and the person using the program finds out. Now the value lives
//! in exactly one place (`Settings`), and the store saves that record WHOLE. To lose a setting one has
//! to fail to create a field.
